        <p className='indentQ'>Q: I'm a new potential client. Can I make an appointment or book a consultation?</p>
        <p className='indentA'>A: I'm currently not taking any appointments at this time. I am fully booked a month an advance.
        If my waitlist is open, you should join and I will reach out to you when you are next on the list, to take a spot when someone cancels.</p>
        <p className='indentQ'>Q: Can I book an appointment if I have used box color within the last 5 years?</p>
        <p className='indentA'>A: I'm not accepting any clients who have colored their own hair, using drug store dye, including sally's colors.
        The hair is difficult to lift and you will need to find a color correction specialist.</p>
        <p className='indentQ'>Q: Will our schedules match up?</p>
        <p className='indentA'>A: I don't do color on Saturday's. My schedule is Wednesday and Friday 8am-3pm, Thursday 8am-8pm, and Saturday 8am-5pm.
        My latest color appointment is at 2:30pm. First time color clients, the session could take 6-8 hours.</p>
        <p className='indentQ'>Q: Do I require a deposit?</p>
        <p className='indentA'>A: Yes. A $50 deposit is due when your first appointment is booked. Your deposit is non refundable and will go towards your first appointment.</p>
