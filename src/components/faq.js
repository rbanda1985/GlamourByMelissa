        My latest color appointment is at 2:30pm. First time color clients, the session could take 6-8 hours.</p>
        <p className='indentQ'>Q: Do you require a deposit?</p>
        <p className='indentA'>A: Once you have filled out a consulation form, which is under the services tab in the menu of the site. I will be reaching out to set an in person consulation. Consultations are $40 and must be paid prior to booking the appointment.</p>
